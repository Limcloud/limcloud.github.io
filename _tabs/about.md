Hi! I’m Limberth — a Technical Adoption Manager based in Costa Rica, focused on the VMware/Broadcom stack across LATAM.  
Here I share **practical how-to guides and automation recipes** tested in the field or in my home lab: **VCF, vSphere, Aria Automation/Operations,Powershel/PowerCLI**. 

I have a solid infrastructure background working with SDDC and multi-cloud technologies, holding several VMware and 3rd party certifications, I also enjoy learning new technologies and keeping sharp my technical skills all the time.
